This folder has the final design with and without the padframe. 
If the folder name ends with flat the previous term says which part is flattened
For instance, "Final8x8flat" means only the 8x8 is flattened

I seem to recall that the design would not load probably if everything was still instanced, so probably look at the flattened folders only. 

There is also an "OTHERS" folder which has the other designs/instances that were used for the final.

The Final Lab Report is also in this folder. If images are too small try zooming in. The only things that were changed in the report compared to the partial design report was the inclusion of a buffer and the proper waveforms/designs for the full padframe design + simulations. All of the changes are hilighted in yellow.
